"""Case definitions for the subagent trials (see engine.py).

Two cases:
  escrow_trade      4 roles; the safe escrow protocol that the skill-compaction
                    pipeline synthesizes from per-role local types. Arms:
                    unchecked (the trade_deadlock prose skills — circular
                    wait), bare (intent + vocabulary only), stjp (validated
                    lean contract + gate + enabled-only scheduling).
  escrow_trade_ext  the same protocol EXTENDED with the SettlementAudit child
                    sub-protocol via stjp_core/compiler/incremental.py (run
                    setup_ext_case.py once to generate protocols/
                    escrow_trade_ext_composed.scr). Exercises: incremental
                    extension artifacts driving real agents.

The stjp-arm per-role contract text is rendered from the Scribble-validated
projection at `engine.py init` time (not hardcoded here), so the agents are
driven by exactly what the compiler produced.
