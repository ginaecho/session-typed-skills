"""formalize.py tests against the REAL Scribble toolchain (no mocking of the
validator — per the program's real-toolchain mandate,
`SEAM_TRAINING_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` §2 "Real toolchain mandate (hard rule)").

Two paths are exercised:

  1. A vendored `skills_safety` set (pr_merge) run through the ACTUAL
     --no-llm formalize pipeline. This is the empirical funnel result this
     task reports: real, unformatted skill prose has no fenced
     ```localtype block and doesn't match the strict STJP `*_skills.md`
     heading format, so deterministic compaction cannot proceed and the
     team is dropped at `compactor_survived` with a specific, legible
     reason — proving the fail path is real, not a bug.

  2. A synthetic 4-role team WITH fenced localtype blocks (the same escrow
     trade fixture `stjp_core/tests/test_skill_compactor.py` uses) to prove
     the success path: compaction -> compatibility -> deterministic
     synthesis -> REAL Scribble validation -> DatasetRecord, end to end.
