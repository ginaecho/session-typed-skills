"""W16 LLM-read extraction driver.

Loads the 13 mined teams (same harvest as W8), applies MANUALLY DECIDED
(by the extraction model -- a Claude session reading each skill's full text,
not an automated heuristic) fenced ```localtype blocks per role, writes
block-annotated copies + an evidence sidecar per team, then runs each team's
(possibly role-reduced) annotated dir through the REAL deterministic
pipeline: skill_compactor.compact_and_synthesize(..., llm_client=None) ->
ScribbleValidator, exactly as formalize.py does.

Usage (from repo root, after staging the three remote checkouts -- see
docs/reference/reports/seam/W8_miner.md sec 1 for the clone commands and
docs/reference/reports/seam/W16_llm_read_extraction.md for this run's own
probe):

    python -m experiments.seam_bench.mining.llm_read.extraction \\
        --remote-root <dir containing awesome-copilot/, VoltAgent/, anthropic-skills/> \\
        --scratch-dir <scratch dir for annotated copies + .scr outputs>

Writes, under --scratch-dir: annotated/<team>/<Role>.md (block-annotated
copies), pipeline_out/<team>.scr (synthesized global protocols),
extraction_summary.json (per-team coverage + pipeline verdict),
evidence_sidecars/<team>.json (verbatim evidence quote per extracted edge +
exclusion reasons for every no-block role).
