"""ledger.py — provenance ledger, one record per harvested artifact.

Every artifact `harvest.py` finds gets exactly one `LedgerEntry`: source
repo, license (verbatim SPDX id + a verbatim quote from the license file —
never a guess), commit SHA, path, retrieval route. Items without a
permissive license verdict are **quarantined**: `formalize.py` refuses to
run them through the compactor and `run_mining.py` refuses to emit a
`DatasetRecord` for anything a quarantined artifact contributed to (§
"Provenance/license ledger" in the task card).

License facts below were read directly off the checked-out repos during
this task's harvest run (not guessed, not carried over unverified from an
older report):

  - `github/awesome-copilot`   MIT, root `LICENSE` ("MIT License /
    Copyright GitHub, Inc."), commit `30472ecf0f...` (HEAD at harvest time).
  - `VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents`   MIT, root `LICENSE` ("MIT
    License / Copyright (c) 2025 VoltAgent"), commit `947b44ca0c...`.
  - `anthropics/skills`   Apache-2.0 **per skill folder** (`LICENSE.txt`
    inside each `skills/<name>/`), commit `9d2f1ae187...`. Four skill
    folders (`docx`, `pdf`, `pptx`, `xlsx`) ship a **restrictive**,
    source-available `LICENSE.txt` ("users may not: ... Reproduce or copy
    these materials ... Create derivative works") — those paths are
    quarantined by prefix regardless of the repo-level Apache-2.0 default.

The in-repo `skills_safety` vendored sets are each traced to their real
upstream repo (per that case's `SOURCES.md`, already human-verified) rather
than credited to this repo — `IN_REPO_UPSTREAMS` below is a direct
transcription of those six `SOURCES.md` tables.
