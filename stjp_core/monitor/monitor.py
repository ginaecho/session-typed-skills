Runtime Monitor

Walks a per-role EFSM against a trace of events, detecting:
  - Off-protocol messages (label not in current state's transitions)
  - Premature termination (stopped in non-accepting state)
  - Capability escalation (sent to/received from unexpected peer)

Based on: Bocchi, Chen, Demangeon, Honda, Yoshida — FORTE'13 / TCS'17
  "If every endpoint's local monitor enforces its projected local type,
   the global protocol is observably satisfied."

Each monitor only knows its own role's EFSM. Global compliance falls out
of local compliance — no central observer needed.
