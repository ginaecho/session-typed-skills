## 1 · Live run (n=1, 2026-06-11, Azure AI Foundry, gpt-4o)

| metric | A · intent only | B · + global type | C · projected local | C-min · slim local |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| goal completion (strict) | 0% (0% even role-pair) | 0% | **100%** | 0% |
| events / violations | 19 / **19** | 24 / 16 | 12 / **0** | 11 / 3 |
| attempts used | 3 (all failed) | 3 (all failed) | 2 (2nd succeeded) | 3 (all failed) |
| LLM calls | 23 | 41 | 54 | 68 |
| prompt tokens | 13,489 | 65,735 | 60,526 | 42,247 |
| completion tokens | 1,028 | 1,825 | 2,505 | 2,583 |
| **total tokens** | 14,517 | 67,560 | **63,031** | 44,830 |

B passed G1–G5 but never delivered the final report (G6) — it spent 67.6k tokens
and finished nothing. C is the only finite cost-of-success.

## 2 · Anatomy of the 63k — it is NOT the contract that's long

Installed system prompts (persisted in `runs/<ts>/prompts/<arm>/index.json`):

| arm | per-role system prompt | 6-role total |
|---|---|---|
| A · intent only | 1,870 chars each | 11.2k chars (~2.8k tok) |
| B · global type pasted | 5,995–6,003 chars each | 36.0k chars (~9.0k tok) |
| C · projected local (verbose) | 2,672–4,646 chars | 19.5k chars (~4.9k tok) |
| **C-min · slim local** | **1,063–1,986 chars** | **8.1k chars (~2.0k tok)** |

Two facts that answer the question:

1. **Projection already shrinks the protocol.** Each role's local contract is
   half the size of the pasted global type, and the *slim* variant is smaller
   than the intent-only prompt itself (the SEND/RECV table replaces the
   "figure out who talks to whom" prose). The contract is cheap.

2. **The cost is calls × per-call prompt, and the call count is the harness's,
   not the contract's.** The live C trial: 54 calls for 12 delivered protocol
   messages ≈ **4.5 LLM calls per message**. The turn loop polls every role
   each round; idle roles read their full prompt + session view and answer
   `WAIT`. Attempt 1 stalled after 1 event and burned ~14k tokens before the
   retry. So:

   ```
   63k ≈ 54 calls × (≈850 tok static contract + growing session view + JSON scaffold)
         └── ~75% of it is re-reading static text and WAIT-polling
   ```

   Setting B pays even more per call (1,603 tok — every role re-reads the whole
   global type every turn) and still fails: spending the tokens on the wrong
   shape of information.

---

## 3 · How to slim further — keep the contract meaning, cut the waste

Ordered by payoff; the first three need zero change to the contracts themselves.

1. **EFSM-driven scheduling (biggest lever, est. 2–4×).** (EFSM = extended
   finite-state machine, the step-by-step map of a role's allowed
   transitions.) The projection tells
   the harness *exactly* which roles can act in the current state — that's what
   a local type is. Poll only roles with an enabled SEND (or a pending RECV
   driving a SEND). Idle-role WAIT calls (~75% of calls) disappear. The
   monitor already tracks every role's EFSM state, so the scheduler is free.
2. **Projected views, not full history.** Each per-turn user prompt replays the
   whole session from the role's POV. The local type defines which messages a
   role can even observe — send only the delta since the role's last turn.
   Caps the linear growth in prompt tokens per call.
3. **Prompt-cache the static prefix.** The contract is identical on every call;
   with Azure OpenAI prompt caching the ~850-token prefix re-reads at cached
   price. No behavioural change at all.
4. **Retry the stalled role, not the attempt.** Attempt-level retry re-runs
   the whole pipeline (the live C trial paid ~14k for a 1-event stall; the
   C-min trial paid twice). The monitor knows precisely which role is stuck at
   which state — re-prompt just that role with its expected transitions.
5. **Slim contract (`min` builder) — already implemented, use with care.** It
   cuts the contract 58% and total tokens ~16% (n=10), but GCR drops 80→60%
   and the live n=1 trial failed on a branch slip + ordering slip the verbose
   prompt prevents. The verbose arm's extra ~430 tokens/call buys
   determinism — at n=10 it is *cheaper per success* (42k vs 47k). Don't slim
   the contract below the point where retries eat the savings.

The honest headline: **the projected local contract is already the cheap part;
the next savings come from letting the projection drive the *runtime* (scheduling,
views, retries), not from shaving more characters off the prompt.** That is
also the pitch: the same artifact that proves deadlock-freedom is the thing
that makes the runtime efficient.

# Part 2 — same evening: results under the v2.1 consequence-graded design

The fairness objection ("violation = deviation by definition") is now answered
with data. New instrumentation:

- `experiments/scripts/severity_grader.py` — post-hoc S0–S4 grading over any
  events.jsonl (no reruns needed), driven by per-case
  `protocols/severity.yaml` (semantic milestones, partial order, irreversible
  actions + their authorizations).
- New case live: **banking** — protocol LLM-drafted *this session* (Scribble
  rejected 4 unsafe drafts before accepting the 5th; log in
  `cases/banking/protocols/llm_drafts/drafts_log.json`), goals re-anchored
  (hand-corrected for payloadless labels + branch tags), run
  `cases/banking/runs/20260611T183251-n2-dual`.

## 2.1 Finance re-scored: raw violations → severity histogram (n=10 run)

| arm | raw viol. | S0 benign | S1 waste | S2 obligation | S3 no-finish | **S4 disaster** | harmful att. | P(fail \| S2+/S4) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A · intent | 184 | 134 | 8 | 14 | 24 | **4** | 50% | 100% |
| B · global | 63 | 89 | 0 | 3 | 18 | 0 | 12% | 100% |
| C · local | 0 | 49 | 0 | 4 | 5 | **2** | 11% | 100% |
| C-min | 23 | 65 | 0 | 7 | 4 | **3** | 20% | 100% |

What changed in the story:

- **A's case is no longer circular.** Of 184 raw violations, 134 were benign
  dialect (S0) — *not counted*. The damning number is now concrete: **the
  report was filed before approval/audit 4 times in 30 attempts.**
- **C is not spotless — and that's a feature of the metric.** Its 2 disasters
  are `report before audit_done`: agents *chose* the standard branch on
  high-revenue trials. A local type constrains paths, not choices — policing
  the choice needs the refinement guard at the branch point
  (`amount > 50000 ⇒ high`). Known, fixable, honest.
- **Validation (Move 3): P(goal-failure | harmful deviation) = 100% in every
  arm.** Consequence-graded deviations predict outcome failure perfectly;
  benign ones don't. The monitor measures harm, not difference.

## 2.2 Banking — the case where S4 is denominated in dollars (n=2, live)

Set A/B numbers (`summary.json`/`summary_eval.json`):

| metric | A · intent | B · global | C · local | C-min |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| goal completion (strict) | 0% | 50% | **100%** | **100%** |
| attempts to success | – | 2 | **1** | **1** |
| total tokens (2 trials) | 22.8k | 98.9k | 84.6k | **53.3k** |
| raw monitor violations | 33/33 | 14/27 | 8/18 | 8/18 |

Severity grading:

| arm | S0 | S1 | S2 | S3 | **S4** | harmful att. |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A · intent | 2 | 10 | 8 | 0 | **2 — `debit before authorized`** | 50% |
| B · global | 14 | 4 | 0 | 4 | 0 | 0% |
| C · local | 7 | 4 | 1 | 0 | **0** | 50%* |
| C-min | 11 | 0 | 1 | 0 | **0** | 50%* |

The two headline findings:

1. **Intent-only agents moved money before authorization, twice in 6
   attempts.** Not "deviated from our protocol" — performed the irreversible
   act the demand explicitly gates. Nothing in the intent-only stack flagged
   it; only the monitor saw it.
2. **The letter-vs-consequence gap, demonstrated on our own arm.** In the
   large-branch C trial the agents skipped two `Notify…` messages; the
   EFSM desynced and the raw monitor flagged **8/10 subsequent events** as
   violations — yet the semantic order (request ≺ route ≺ approve ≺ debit ≺
   settle) was intact, zero disasters, goals 4/4, delivered first attempt.
   Old metric: "8 violations." New metric: "1 skipped notification obligation
   (S2), no harm, delivered." (*That S2 is also why `harmful att. 50%` —
   1 of 2 attempts — overstates n=2 granularity; at n≥10 this will wash out.)

C-min note: in banking the slim contract matched verbose C at 100% completion
for 37% fewer tokens — opposite of the finance n=1 result, consistent with
"slim works when the protocol shape is simple; verbose buys determinism on
branchy shapes."

## 2.3 What's still open

- n=2 is a smoke run (a quick end-to-end check, not a statistically sized
  sample): repeat banking at n≥10 (large/small balanced) before
  quoting percentages.
- Approval-payload check: the grader treats `Approval(False)` as the
  `authorized` milestone (no payload predicates yet) — a denied-but-debited
  path would currently escape S4. Add payload conditions to severity.yaml
  matchers.
- The demo's replay graphs are finance-specific; banking needs its own graph
  defs before it joins `STJP_Benchmark_Demo.html` (scoreboard severity chart
  is already case-agnostic).

# Part 3 — why typed agents still committed S4, and what closes the gap

The finance S4s (`report before audit_done`, 2/18 spec attempts at n=10) were
traced to their artifacts. Three distinct causes, in order of depth:

## 3.1 The type cannot say it (theory gap)

The agent's actual contract at the decision point
(`runs/20260611T175113/prompts/spec_llmvalid/RevenueAnalyst.system.md`):

```
### State 26
- SEND to TaxVerifier: HighRevenueNotification(String) -> state 27
- SEND to TaxVerifier: StandardRevenueNotification(String) -> state 34
```

Both branches, equal standing, **no condition**. Classic MPST (multiparty
session types, the theory behind Scribble; and stock
Scribble) has no value-dependent choice: an internal choice belongs to the
role, and *which* branch to take given the data is not expressible in the
type. Taking the standard branch on $75k revenue is **protocol-legal** — the
projection, the monitor, and Scribble all correctly accept it. The harmful
run was not a violation of the contract; it was a hole *in* the contract.

## 3.2 The guards were not even there (toolchain gap)

`protocols/llm_drafts/valid/` contains **no `.refn` file** — the refinement
sidecar exists only for the canonical protocol's vocabulary. So the WITH-arms
running against the LLM-drafted protocol had *zero* payload guards; the
prompt's "a payload that fails a Refinement Invariant will be REJECTED" line
was an empty threat. The drafting step must emit a re-anchored `.refn`
alongside the drafted `.scr` (same lesson as goals.yaml, third instance of
the same drift class).

## 3.3 Prose is not enforcement (LLM gap)

The >$50k rule WAS stated — twice, in prose (intent + role description).
The agent read it and still chose standard in 2/18 attempts. This is the
same lesson as Setting B at full strength: the entire validated global type
in the prompt yields 33–60% adherence. **Prompts move probabilities;
only checks move guarantees.**

## The fix, layer by layer

1. **Define it — choice-point refinements.** Extend the `.refn` sidecar
   (no Scribble fork, consistent with the existing layering) with guards at
   choice states:
   `[RevenueAnalyst @ 26] when float(RawRevenueData.x) > 50000 require HighRevenueNotification`.
   Emit the drafted-vocabulary `.refn` in the same LLM step that drafts the
   protocol.
2. **State it where the decision happens.** Compile the guard into the
   contract *at State 26* as a HARD conditional, not as prose at the top of
   the prompt — LLMs follow point-of-decision instructions far better than
   global preambles.
3. **Check it — value-tracking monitor.** The monitor already sees
   `RawRevenueData(75000)` before the choice; bind received payloads and
   evaluate choice guards at the branch event → new verdict
   `choice_guard_violation` (lands in S4 when the skipped branch gates an
   irreversible act).
4. **Enforce it — gate mode (the proposed C+ arm).** Observer mode makes harm
   *visible*; only a gate makes it *impossible to complete*: monitor rejects
   the off-guard send before delivery (before the side effect, for
   irreversible actions) and re-prompts the role with its expected
   transitions. Bounded retries + escalation preserve liveness.

## So: do we really need the local monitor?

Yes — it is the only layer in the stack that produces guarantees, and each
layer demonstrably earns a different thing in our own data:

| layer | what it buys | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Scribble validation | no deadlock/livelock, proven for ALL runs | 4 unsafe banking drafts rejected pre-runtime |
| projection → local contract | compliance becomes *likely*, cheaply | 0% → 80–100% goal completion |
| local monitor (observer) | harm becomes *visible* | intent-only's unauthorized debits — nothing else flagged them |
| local monitor (gate) + choice guards | harm becomes *non-completable* | closes the remaining 2/18 (by construction) |

Even with perfect agents the monitor stays: it is the audit trail that makes
S0–S4 grading, the benchmark itself, and any compliance claim measurable.
