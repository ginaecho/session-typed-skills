## Building the Paper

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have LaTeX installed:

```bash
# macOS (with Homebrew)
brew install mactex

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install texlive-full

# Windows
# Download from https://www.tug.org/texlive/windows.html
```

### Building from Source

Navigate to the desired version and run:

```bash
cd v8  # or v7, v6
make   # Compiles main.tex -> main.pdf
```

Or manually:

```bash
pdflatex main.tex
bibtex main
pdflatex main.tex
pdflatex main.tex
```

### Regenerating Figures

To regenerate figures from the diagram files:

```bash
python make_figs_v2.py
```

This requires:
- Python 3
- draw.io CLI (for `.drawio` files)
- ImageMagick (for image conversions)

## Version History

- **v8** - Latest version: *"Guarantees, Not Averages: Type-Checking Agent Conversations with Multiparty Session Types"* (supersedes v7). Three groups of changes:
  1. **Repositioning (ICLR-facing)** - thesis-first title; abstract ~40% shorter and empirical-first; contributions reordered (judge-free eval + CGC and the three empirical regularities lead, guarantee transfer follows).
  2. **Concurrent/adjacent work cited and positioned** - ZipperGen (Bollig–Függer–Nowak, arXiv:2604.17612) in Related Work plus a new Table 1 row; Contribution 1 rescoped to cite its own counterexample inline; also Li–Stutz–Wies–Zufferey (CAV'23 / OOPSLA'25 / ITP'25), Paduraru et al. (arXiv:2603.18096), and Kaptein et al. + EU AI Act motivation (arXiv:2603.16586).
  3. **New content** - §3.2 merge-as-lint flip; §7 "The seam is trainable, not merely open"; Limitations translation-seam paragraph updated to verifier-in-the-loop framing.

  See `v8/CHANGELOG_v8.md` for all edits with rationale and `v8/README.txt` for build/status notes.
